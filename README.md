# I-Need-To-Survive
A simple stick figure zombie game that is currently a work in progress. I loved the game "The Last Stand" from armorgames.com as a kid and recently revisited the game for nostalgic reasons. It inspired me to make my own version, but with stick figures. Why? Because I also grew up playing stick figure games from stickpage.com. I miss the good ol' days of Flash games ðŸ˜”. 

So far, it involves movement in delta time.. but respawning and collisions with zombies will be implemented. Music and a dramatic intro screen and death screen will be implemented as well. Let's do it.
